"cast : Steve Carell as Gru , a mean supervillain Jason Segel as Victor "" Vector "" Perkins , Mr. Perkins ' son and Gru 's archenemy Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario , Gru 's elderly gadget man and a friendly scientist critical response : Since villains so often steal the show in animation , Despicable Me smartly turns the whole operation over to megalomaniacal rogue Gru . Despicable Me is a 3D cartoon comedy of whiplash - quick laughs , funny punch lines and a wickedly gimmicky appreciation for 3D.

Short , sweet - and - sour , and amusing rather than funny , Despicable Me ca n't help but be likable . It 's no first - rank CGI cartoon , but shows how Pixar 's quality over crass is inspiring the mid - list .
