"William Shakespeare ( William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . He is often called England 's national poet and the "" Bard of Avon "" . His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 39 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period .""fun_facts"": [

 This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value , and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture . 
 Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography , by its repertoire of movements , or by its historical period or place of origin . 
 An important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance , although these two categories are not always completely separate ; both may have special functions , whether social , ceremonial , competitive , erotic , martial , or sacred / liturgical . 
 Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance - like quality , including martial arts , gymnastics , cheerleading , figure skating , synchronized swimming , marching bands , and many other forms of athletics .""fun_facts"": [

"William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist .

"William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . He is often called England 's national poet and the "" Bard of Avon "" . His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 39 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period .""fun_facts"": [
          ""Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today. Some of these include: \u201cGood riddance. In my heart of hearts. Laughing stock. Wild-goose chase. Devil incarnate. Brave new world. As luck would have it. All our yesterdays. Break the ice. Full circle.\u201d"",

"A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity , is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion , and has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals . The term planet is ancient , with ties to history , astrology , science , mythology , and religion . Five planets in the Solar System are visible to the naked eye . These were regarded by many early cultures as divine , or as emissaries of deities . As scientific knowledge advanced , human perception of the planets changed , incorporating a number of disparate objects . In 2006 , the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System . This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit . Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain "" planets "" under the modern definition , some celestial bodies , such as Ceres , Pallas , Juno and Vesta ( each an object in the solar asteroid belt ) , and Pluto ( the first trans - Neptunian object discovered ) , that were once considered planets by the scientific community , are no longer viewed as such .

"Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times , it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations , performed by Galileo Galilei . 
 As observational tools improved , astronomers saw that , like Earth , each of the planets rotated around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole , and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons . 
 On December 20 , 2011 , the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the discovery of the first Earth - sized extrasolar planets , Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f , orbiting a Sun - like star , Kepler-20 . 
 A 2012 study , analyzing gravitational microlensing data , estimates an average of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way . Around one in five Sun - like stars is thought to have an Earth - sized planet in its habitable zone .""fun_facts"": [

"Fish are gill - bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits . They form a sister group to the tunicates , together forming the olfactores . Included in this definition are the living hagfish , lampreys , and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups . Tetrapods emerged within lobe - finned fishes , so cladistically they are fish as well . However , traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods ( i.e. , the amphibians , reptiles , birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry ) . Because in this manner the term "" fish "" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group , it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology , unless it is used in the cladistic sense , including tetrapods . The traditional term pisces ( also ichthyes ) is considered a typological , but not a phylogenetic classification .""fun_facts"": [

"Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia .
