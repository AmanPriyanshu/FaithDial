"Basketball is a team sport in which two teams , most commonly of five players each , opposing one another on a rectangular court , compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball ( approximately 9.4 inches ( 24 cm ) in diameter ) through the defender 's hoop ( a basket 18 inches ( 46 cm ) in diameter mounted 10 feet ( 3.048 m ) high to a backboard at each end of the court ) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop .   A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three - point line , when it is worth three .   After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one - point free throws .   The team with the most points at the end of the game wins , but if regulation play expires with the score tied , an additional period of play ( overtime ) is mandated .

"CHARLOTTESVILLE & mdash ; Charles Snowden gripped the sledgehammer tightly , raised it over his head and swung straight down with all his might , demolishing into pebbles and dust a chunk of stone placed on the floor of the Virginia football team&rsquo;s locker room.&ldquo;Breaking the rock&rdquo ; has become a raucous part of the Cavaliers&rsquo ; victory celebrations this season , including following a 27 - 3 romp over Louisville in the ACC opener Saturday during which Snowden filled the defensive stat sheet in virtually every category . The performance earned the linebacker was the third player , and first non - senior , to take part in the tradition that Shawn Griswold , the team&rsquo;s first - year director of football development and performance , introduced at the start of the season . Given how briskly Snowden has ascended into a difference - maker despite a limited football background , Coach Bronco Mendenhall indicated he expects the sophomore from Silver Spring , Md. , who played less than two full seasons at the varsity level in high school at St. Albans in the District , to be a frequent boulder buster . His next chance will be Saturday afternoon when Virginia ( 3 - 1 , 1 - 0 ) plays at N.C. State ( 3 - 0 , 0 - 0).&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where the limit is with him,&rdquo ; Mendenhall said of Snowden , who stands 6 feet 7 and weights 225 pounds . & ldquo;The size , the range , the speed but also the type of person , those type of people , they maximize their abilities . It&rsquo;ll be fun to watch.&rdquo;Starting for just the fourth time in college this past weekend , Snowden collected eight total tackles , including one and a half for loss , two pass breakups , one sack , one interception and one fumble recovery against the Cardinals . The Cavaliers held an ACC opponent without a touchdown for the first time since 2009 and limited the Cardinals to 66 rushing yards . They also forced three turnovers , including Snowden&rsquo;s interception on the second play of the second quarter , leading to Virginia taking the lead for good on its ensuing possession.&ldquo;We had gone over their route combinations all week , so I had a good idea of what they were going to do,&rdquo ; said Snowden , who on Monday was named ACC linebacker of the week .",[],"Hello , how are you ?

"The five players on each side at a time fall into five positions player positions : the tallest player is usually the center , the tallest and strongest is the power forward , a slightly shorter but more agile big man is the small forward , and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard , who implements the coach 's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays ( player positioning ) .

"& ldquo;The quarterback threw the ball , I got a good break , and since I&rsquo;ve been blessed with long arms , I could go out there and grab it.&rdquo;Those long arms , naturally , served Snowden well in basketball , which he played in addition to junior varsity football at Blake , a public high school at Silver Spring . It was St. Albans assistant varsity basketball coach Bobby Fields who initially encouraged Snowden&rsquo;s father , Charles Sr . , to consider the all - boys private school in Northwest D.C. when the two sat next to one another at a basketball game between Blake and Springbrook .

Bulldogs football Coach Gary Schnell gladly inserted Snowden as a hybrid stand - up defensive end - outside linebacker four games into the season . Playing in only seven games that year , Snowden became an all - conference selection . By his senior year , Snowden also was playing wide receiver .",Strange that he would play both .
