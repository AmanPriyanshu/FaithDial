A field goal is worth two points , unless made from behind the three - point line , when it is worth three .   After a foul , timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one - point free throws .

"Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information , such as sound , by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space , such as their amplitude , frequency , phase , or pulse width .

"Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering , as well as the abandonment of former household pets , has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide , requiring population control .   In certain areas outside cats ' native range , this has contributed , along with habitat destruction and other factors , to the extinction of many bird species .   Cats have been known to extirpate a bird species within specific regions and may have contributed to the extinction of isolated island populations .   Results of a genetic study in 2007 showed that all domestic cats descended from the Near Eastern wildcat and diverged around 8000 BC in the Middle East .   A 2017 study confirmed that domestic cats are descendants of those first domesticated by farmers in the Near East around 9,000 years ago . As of a 2007 study , cats are the second - most popular pet in the U.S. by number of pets owned , after freshwater fish .
