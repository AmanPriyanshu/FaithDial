"When the elder Fischer dies in Sydney , Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a ten - hour flight back to Los Angeles , which the team ( including Saito , who wants to verify their success ) uses as an opportunity to sedate and take Fischer into a shared dream . At each dream level , the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a ' kick ' that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level ; to be successful , these kicks must occur simultaneously at each dream level , a fact complicated due to the nature of time which flows much faster in each successive level . The first level is Yusuf 's dream of a rainy Los Angeles . The team abducts Fischer , but they are attacked by armed projections from Fischer 's subconscious , which has been specifically trained to defend him against such intruders . The team takes Fischer and a wounded Saito to a warehouse , where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito up , the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi - level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into ' limbo ' , a world of infinite subconscious from which escape is extremely difficult , if not almost impossible , and a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream . Despite these setbacks , the team continues with the mission .","Wow , that 's impressive . I like to look at Rotten Tomatoes when debating whether or not to see a movie .

"cast : Meryl Streep as Katharine Graham Tom Hanks as Ben Bradlee Sarah Paulson as Antoinette "" Tony "" Pinchot Bradlee Bob Odenkirk as Ben Bagdikian Tracy Letts as Fritz Beebe critical response : The Post passes the trickiest tests of a historical drama : It makes us understand that decisions that have been validated by the lens of history were difficult ones to make in the moment , and it generates suspense over how all the pieces fell into place to make those decisions come to fruition . Nobody needs to be reminded that history tends to go in circles , but The Post is so vital because it captures the ecstasy of trying to break the chain and bend things towards justice ; defending the fundamental tenets of the Constitution has n't been this much fun since Hamilton . has all the makings of an awards season hit , but is too calculated to reflect today 's ragged , tenuous sociopolitical climate . Spielberg makes these crucial days in American history easy to follow . But if you look at The Post next to something like All the President 's Men , you see the difference between having a story passively explained to you and actively helping to untangle it .
